# Drop_Down_Menu_With_jQuery
#In this project I'm going to make a simple dropdown menu with jQuery.

#How will our dropdown menu work?

Dropdown menus work by simply hiding the sub-menu lists by setting the visibility to hidden in our css. Then when the mouse rolls over a first leve menu item we'll use jquery to alter the css and set visibility to visible. Simple. This is essentially how all dropdown menus work. I bet you thought there was more to it right? Of course we can then use jQuery to animate the change, set how long the sub menu stays open for and add other style elements like drop shadows and whatever we need.
